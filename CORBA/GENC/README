===================================================================

This directory contains sample code for building the primer POS
application for a generic C ORB. On the diskette supplied with the book,the filenames are constrained to the MSDOS 8.3 format, in uppercase. The
mapping of MSDOS names to to the names required by the UNIX build
system is shown at the end of this README.

You will also need the IDL files, which are in directory IDL off 
the root directory of this diskette.  

We assume that you will start the application by invoking the executables
with appropriate arguments from the command line. As stated in the
book, because of the simplicity of the example the sequencing of
startup is important. In order to start correctly, the executablers
should be started in the following order, with a pause between each to
allow time for initialisation to complete:

	central office
	output media
	store
	pos

The POS will then require user input.


MSDOS to UNIX Filename Mapping
==============================

This mapping shows the UNIX filenames from which the MSDOS equivalents
have been derived. The supplied UNIX build script assumes the
filenames are in the original UNIX form rather than the form that
files have been supplied on the diskette.

The mapping is shown in a form which should be easy to edit to create
a script to convert the names appropriately once the files have been
transferred to a UNIX system (prefix each line with "mv "). This has
not been provided as a ready made script because the mechanism used to
transfer the files to the UNIX system may well modify the filenames in
the process and will vary from system to system.

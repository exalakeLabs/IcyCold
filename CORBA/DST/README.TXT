This directory contains the Smalltalk sources for the POS example. This file is
a change set file for loading into ParcPlace VisualWorks 2.0. It contains
both the Smalltalk implementation and the IDL code. To run the code you must
also have HP Distributed Smalltalk installed. This code is not intended
to be viewed or run from any other Smalltalk environment. Note that the code is
available for reading in the Smalltalk chapters.

To run the example, copy the files from this directory to the directory from
which you will start your Smalltalk image.

Turn to the book and read the directions starting in section 33.9.

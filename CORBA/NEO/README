Point Of Sale Example - NEO Source Tree
=======================================


Building and Running the Example
--------------------------------
The code found here follows the description of the POS example
found in the book. Two simple scripts are also provided:
	Build.sh: compiles the IDL interfaces and builds each component
	Launch.sh: launches each component in a separate xterm window


Truncated File Names
--------------------
Due to the limitations of DOS formatted floppies, most of the files
found in this source tree have truncated names. However, the file
neo.tar can be used with Unix tar(1) to restore the source tree with
full file names.

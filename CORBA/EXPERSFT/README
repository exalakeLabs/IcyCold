This file provides information on the example program that is part of
the book "CORBA Fundamentals and Programming" published by John Wiley &
Sons.  The following steps provide an explanation of how to install,
build, and run this software.  For a detailed expanation of the of the
application, please refer to the referenced book.

Information on running the IDL compiler can be found in the PowerBroker
Users Guide.

This file is part of the release dated 3-4-96.

Step 1) Check for updates since the book's publication

Note that the software distributed on the diskette has been tested under
Solaris 2.4.  Please visit Expersoft's WWW server (see URL below) to
obtain a version for a different environment.

Expersoft maintains an updated copy of this file and the source code
on its World Wide Web Homepage and anonymous FTP server.  Please look
at the information at the URL:

   http://www.expersoft.com/res_cntr/primer

This README file and the source code is available via anonymous FTP at the following location:

   host:   maxwell.expersoft.com
   login:  anonymous
   file:   /pub/primer/pb/README
   file:   /pub/primer/pb/pbexample.tar.Z

2) Change History

Initial version of example as submitted to publisher

3) Installation from Diskette

If you copy the directory tree from the diskette to a hard drive and notice
that all the file names are upper case, run the script 'fixnames' located in 
the top directory of the example.  fixnames renames the files to match those 
used in the book.  To run it (under csh) type:

  % source FIXNAMES

Or, use the archive as indicated below.  You can either download it or 
copy it from the diskette.

If you downloaded this software from Expersoft's FTP server to your
computer, enter the following commands to install the source tree:

  // Assuming you downloaded the file to the /tmp directory,
  // create a directory for the source tree and copy the archive into it
  % mkdir pb
  % cd pb
  % cp /tmp/pbexample.tar.Z pbexample.tar.Z
  % uncompress pbexample.tar.Z
  % tar xvf pbexample.tar

4) Compilation Instructions

This software has been compiled and tested under Solaris 2.4 using the Sun C++
compiler version 4.0.1.

Assuming PowerBroker and your C++ compiler have been properly installed, type
'make' to compile the 5 programs that comprise the example.  The 'makefile'
will enter each subdirectory and compile and link as appropriate.  If
the example is located in the directory /usr/pb, then type the
following commands to compile the example:

  % cd /usr/pb
  % make

3) How to run the example

Open 5 X-Terminals and change to the 'bin' directory under the installation
directory.  For example, if you installed the example in /usr/pb, type
the following command:

   % cd /usr/pb/bin

From the bin directory, start the programs, one in each window, as follows.
Note that the programs should be started in the order listed.

   % PNSServer
   % CentralServer
   % StoreServer 1 1.1
   % outServer 1
   % POSclt 1 1

The arguments to StoreServer are the store number and markup
percent. This markup is used as follows:
   price = markup * cost
The argument to outSrv is a POS number.
The arguments to POSclt are a store number and POS number.

Multiple POS Terminals can be started by opening additional windows and
running outSrv and POSclt.  Each pair (i.e., outSrv and POSclt) should use
store number '1' and a new POS number.

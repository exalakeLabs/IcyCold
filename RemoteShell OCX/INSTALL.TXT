Due to the overwelming demand for this control, I had to shrink the size of the 
install files to accommodate bandwidth limitations by our service provider.  Please note
that a full install for RemoteShell is still available that includes the full Visual Basic 
runtime for the control.  Please visit http://www.pathguide.com/greg/rsh.htm
to download this version.

To install, simply unzip the all the files to a folder of your choice and run regocx.bat 
from the install folder.  The control will then be ready to use in your development
environment.

Thanks for the support!

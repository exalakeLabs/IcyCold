This file provides information on the example program that is part of
the book "CORBA Fundametals and Programming" published by John Wiley &
Sons.  For a detailed expanation of the of the application, please

INSTALLATION

If you copy the directory tree from the diskette to a hard drive you will need to
run the fixnames script. This is because DOS converts filenames to uppercase; 
'fixnames' renames the files to match those used in the book.  To run it (under 
csh) type:

  % source fixnames

If you do this, you will also need to copy the IDL from directory IDL off 
the root directory of the diskette.  

Alternatively, you can copy the file GENCPTAR.Z from this diskette's directory 
TARFILES to your UNIX system, uncompress, and un-tar to recover the files with 
proper long mixed-case names.  

Or, use the archive as indicated below.  You can either download it or 
copy it from the diskette.  You can download it from Expersoft's anonymous FTP
site as follows:

   host:   maxwell.expersoft.com
   login:  anonymous
   file:   /pub/primer/generic/README
   file:   /pub/primer/generic/generic.tar.Z

CONFIGURATION INSTRUCTIONS

This is a 'generic' C++ version of the example in that all ORB
specific code and makefile directives have been removed.  To tailor
this source code to your ORB follow these steps.

1) Edit each makefile and add references to include directories and
   libraries.

   Each makefile defines the macros INCLUDE, LIBRARY, CFLAGS.  This is
   where you will add '-I', '-L', and '-l' directives.

   Each makefile contains the include statement "include ../make.cfg".
   make.cfg defines suffix rules and the macros SOURCE and OBJECTS.
   The suffix rule .idl.o define how IDL gets compiled (this rule also
   typically compiles generated C++ files)

   The suffix rule .C.o defines how C++ files are compiled (if you define
   .idl.o as I describe above, this rule will compile ONLY non-generated
   source files.

2) Edit the header files in the subdirectories utilities, POS, PNS,
   store, and central.

   Update include statements to include header files generated by
   your IDL compiler.  Each include statement that needs to be edited
   is indicated in the source file with the characters '###'.

   Add the names of base classes to implementation class declarations.
   These lines are also indicatd with the characters '###'.

3) Edit .C files in the subdirectories utilities, POS, PNS, store, and
   central to include header files generated by your IDL compiler
   (yes, look for '###').
